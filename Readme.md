# üíº PayrollPal Backend

## ‚ùì What

The backend of the PayrollPal application provides the necessary server-side functionality to support the frontend in streamlining contract management and automating payments for TikTok creators.

## üíª Technologies Used

üíº PayrollPal Backend is built using the following technologies:

- Node.js: A runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server.
- Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js.
- PostgreSQL: A powerful, open-source relational database system.
- Sequelize: An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for Node.js.
- Authentication: Implement user authentication for secure access.

## üìú Getting Started

To set up the üíº PayrollPal Backend and make it work seamlessly with the frontend, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/KenHo95/payrollpal-backend.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd payrollpal-backend`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Set up the PostgreSQL database: Configure database connection in `config/config.json`.
5. Run database migrations: `npx sequelize db:migrate`
6. Start the server: `nodemon index.js`
7. Ensure the backend is running on the appropriate port (e.g., `http://localhost:3001`).

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine before proceeding with the installation.

## üöÄ Using the Backend with the Frontend

üí° **Integration**: To fully utilize the PayrollPal application, both the Frontend and Backend components should be used together. The [PayrollPal Frontend](https://github.com/KenHo95/payrollpal-frontend) interacts with this backend to provide a seamless experience for contract management and payment automation.

Please ensure that you have both the Frontend and Backend components set up and configured to work together for the complete functionality of PayrollPal.

For detailed instructions on setting up and running the frontend, refer to the [PayrollPal Frontend README](https://github.com/KenHo95/payrollpal-frontend).
